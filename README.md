This was a project to build an interactive map where my son could find Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) gyms in which UFC Fighters fight out of; these are red pins.  The map also shows surrounding colleges; blue pins.  THe working map can be viewed at https://sites.google.com/view/mma-gym-finder/home

I included the files I used to create this map.  I collected fighter names from ufc.com and then I used tapology.com to scrape the fighters associated gym and addresses.  I used a geocode plugin on google sheets to determine the latitiude and longitude of all addresses.  The college information came from a website that listed all U.S. colleges and universities.
